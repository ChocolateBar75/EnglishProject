				<h2>The National African Congress</h2>
				<article class="indent">
					Starting in 1912 in Bloemfontein the founders of the ANC were a group of native black Africans and Indians to improve the status of non-whites in South Africa. When the South African government issued territorial segregation in 1913, the ANC would petition the British government to get involved to no success. The group would continue to petition while at the same time they began The African Congress Youth Leage(ANCYL). Recruiting people like Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, and Walter Sisulu which would grow the ANC more, changing the tactics used, and challenging discrimintaion in different ways.

					When Apartheid officially began ANC would start a defiance campaign which included women. The group would also create an Freedom Charter declaring that South Africa belongs the everyone no matter what race the person is. More extreme group then broke off of the ANC forming the Pan African Congress(PAC). The PAC would also declare that South Africa belongs to the black natives of the region.

					It was after the Sharpsville Massacre where police fired on unarmed protestors and the government declared an state of emergency when the ANC was banned in the country. Of course just because the government made organization out lawed doesn’t mean the group disbanded. In the early sixties the group adopted a more violent apporch. With the increase adopting of violence the ANC formed a millitant wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. For the next years the group would commit sabotage and violence that led to the arrest of multiple key figures like Nelson Mandela. It was after Mandela’s trial where the Anc went more underground and adopted guerilla warfare tactics having bases in neighboring countries.

					Decades later in the eighties ANC coordinated sabotage and guerilla attacks which led to South Africa and its western allies declared the group as an terrorist organization lauching attacks on the bases. Due to the attacks from the West most of ANC’s support came from Cuba and the Soviet Union. In 1990 the pressures from the international community made F. W. de Klerk reinstate ANC and released Mandela from prison. ANC being led by Mandela won the first democratic election in 1994.
